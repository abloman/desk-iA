  "summary": "Completed comprehensive backend testing of AlphaMind Trading Assistant v5 focusing on Gold/Silver price accuracy, CME futures 10-minute delay, trading mode SL multipliers, and signal generation. All 42 backend tests passed with 100% success rate. Key v5 features verified: Gold price ~$2680, Silver price ~$31, CME futures (ES/NQ) have proper 10-min delay, scalping mode uses 0.5x SL multiplier (tighter), intraday uses 1.0x (normal), swing uses 1.5x (wider), signal generation works across all markets, trade execution functional, Claude integration working with 95% confidence signals.",
